# DL_Spring2022

This repository is for spring 2022 Deep Learning course where i put my assignments assigned throughout the semester. These assignments are a good practice for acquiring basic knowledge regarding Deep learning.

## Assignment Descriptions

### HW1

The hw1 required us to to solve the Image Colorization task as a pixel-wise classification problem. CIFAR-10 was the dataset used in this assignment.

### HW2

We fine-tuned ParsBERT model to solve the Sentiment Analysis task. [Taaghche](https://www.kaggle.com/saeedtqp/taaghche) was the dataset used in this assignment which consists of book ratings available on taghche as of 2019.

### HW3

This assignment required us to develop LSTM/GRU networks to address a demonstration time-series prediction problem.
Google Stock Dataset was the dataset used in this assignment.
