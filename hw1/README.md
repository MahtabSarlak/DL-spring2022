# Image Colorization with Convolutional Neural Network

This assignment required us to solve the Image Colorization task as a pixel-wise classification problem. So we apply a CNN to colorize grayscale images using the PyTorch framework, and we examin how diffØ«rent factors such as Batch normalization, Skip Connection, ... affect the result of the learning process.

### Dataset

CIFAR-10 will be the dataset used in this assignment which consists of images of size 32x32 pixels. For simplicity, one category of this dataset is considered (automobile).link

Also, the subset of 24 colors that are selected to colorize the grayscale images is provided in the python file.
